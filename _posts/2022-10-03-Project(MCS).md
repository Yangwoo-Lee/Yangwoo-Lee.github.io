## Reactivity Difference of Alite and Belite through DFT

### 1.Introduction

**Abstract**

This study focused on evaluation of service life of reinforced concrete structure exposed to marine environment through probabilistic method. To calculated the time to steel corrosion, the rate of chloride transport was assumed by COV from other literature and mean value from in-situ data for Monte Carlo Simulation.
