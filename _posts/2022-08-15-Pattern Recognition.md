### Course Outline

Pattern recognition deals with the problem of finding the characteristics of a given data set by using a prior knowledge or statistical information of the data, and to classify the data into several categories on the basis of the characteristics. The dimension of the data is usually very high to visualize. When there is a priori information about the data, some typical methods in pattern recognition are the Bayes classifier, maximum likelihood method, discriminant analysis and artificial neural networks. When there is no prior information, data can be classified by clustering methods. Pattern recognition is used in bio recognition, such as face and fingerprint, and also in search for new knowledge in vastly accumulated data. This course introduces several typical methods used in pattern recognition and deals with its application.


### Goals

Fundamental techniques for pattern recognition are introduced, including Learning Rules (Cross Entropy, Mutual Information, ICA, SupportVector Machines, Error Backpropagation rules), Bayesian Frameworks(Bayesian Decision/Inference, Bayesian Networks, Parametric /NonparametricDensity Estimation), Regression Analysis(Linear/Nonlinear Regression, PCA, Partial Regression, Gaussian Process Regression, Kalman Filter).
