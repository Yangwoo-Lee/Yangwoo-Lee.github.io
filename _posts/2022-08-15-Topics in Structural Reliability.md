### Course Outline

The subject of structural reliability offers a rational framework to quantify uncertainties mathematically. The subject combines theories of probability, random variables and random processes with principles of structural mechanics and forms the basis on which modern structural design codes are developed. The present course aims to introduce the basics of the structural reliability analysis procedures; Formulation of reliability for structural components and systems. Exact solutions, first- and second-order reliability methods. Reliability indices. Simulation based methods. Reliability sensitivity measures.

### Goals

This course offers a comprehensive review of structural reliability assessment methods and their applications to engineering problems in general. Topics include formulation of structural reliability, first-order and second-order reliability methods (FORM and SORM), system reliability analysis, structural reliability analysis under model or statistical uncertainties, simulation methods and uncertainty quantification methods. Students will apply the methods to example problems using available computer codes. As a final term project, each student will apply or develop reliability methods for an engineering/science application he/she chooses.
